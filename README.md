A simple text editor written in Python that uses Tkinter library. No Syntax Highlighting (yet)
*This project is on its early stages, pretty bad currently. Contributions are highly appreciated, to contribute just open a pull request with the edits (do not give me suggestions, give me code instead XD well tbh i don't have enough time to code even if you give me suggestions.).*
